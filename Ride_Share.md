Ride Share Project

This project takes data provided by Divvy Bikes, https://divvybikes.com/, to observe the behavior of riders and provide insights to 
encourage non-annual members or casual riders to convert to annual members.

The main metrics observed were:
  1) average number of rides a day by both members and non members
  2) average time spent per trip by both types of members
  3) the usage behavior of the two different bike types ( classic and electric); measured by both trip duration and number of rides
